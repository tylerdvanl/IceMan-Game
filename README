#IceMan-Game

This is the final project for a class titled "Advanced Programming in C++".  We were given a fifty-four page design document 
and an engine to work with in the beginning.  
The only files I wrote anything into are:
 
  Actor.cpp
  Actor.h
  StudentWorld.cpp
  StudentWorld.h

All other files were provided to us.
